## Objectives 

This exercise combines elements Azure Functions, Azure Kubenetes (AKS), and, **enhances** AKS scaling using [KEDA](https://keda.sh/). Integrating and exploting KEDA adds another dimension to leveraging the array of Azure features to provide an organzation addtional flexibility and control for application deployment, scaling and management. Attractive features include:

- Event-drivin scaling
- Autoscaling simplified 
- Templates, built-in scalers based on workload type 
- Natural integration with Azure Functions and Kubernetes
